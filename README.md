## Description
The Oscillator Predictor MT4 is a powerful forex software designed to predict overbought and oversold conditions in the market. It utilizes a combination of moving averages and threshold values to identify potential trading opportunities.

This indicator calculates the Predictor bands using the specified period and then determines the overbought and oversold conditions based on the current closing price and the calculated bands. If the closing price exceeds the upper band and is also above the threshold value, the indicator signals that the market is overbought. Conversely, if the closing price falls below the lower band and is also below the threshold value, the indicator signals that the market is oversold. If none of these conditions are met, the indicator provides no signal.

The Oscillator Predictor MT4 is a versatile tool that can be used in various trading strategies to improve trade entries and exits. It can be applied to any financial instrument and timeframe, providing traders with valuable insights into market conditions.

## Indicator Parameters
- BandsPeriod: The period used for calculating the Predictor bands.
- Threshold: The threshold value used to identify overbought and oversold conditions.

## Indicator Buffers
- PredictorUpper: Buffer for storing the upper band values.
- PredictorLower: Buffer for storing the lower band values.
- PredictorSignal: Buffer for storing the indicator signals.

## Indicator Initialization
The indicator buffers are mapped to the respective buffers using the `SetIndexBuffer` function. The labels for the buffers are set using the `SetIndexLabel` function.

## Indicator Calculation
The indicator calculates the Predictor bands using the `iMA` function and stores the values in the `PredictorUpper` and `PredictorLower` buffers. It then checks the current closing price against the bands and threshold values to determine the overbought and oversold conditions. The corresponding signal values are stored in the `PredictorSignal` buffer.
